1) Download data: Go to code/datasets. In that folder, download http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar-10-python.tar.gz and extract it there. Delete cifar-10-python.tar.gz.

2) Compile the Cython extension: Follow the instructions in README.md. This may be more difficult on Windows depending on what compilers you have available.

3) Submit a zipped version of the entire homework folder, in its original structure. Exclude the 'build' and 'datasets' folders in the 'code' folder.
